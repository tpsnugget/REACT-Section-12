# Repo: REACT-Section-12
# Repo Description: Colt Steele's Modern React Bootcamp, Section 12, Light Out Exercise
   
# Version 1
   This is the way I did the board. The display is partially hardcoded as I can't figure out
   how to do the component with a single line using nested arrays, or with multiple lines for that matter.

# Version 2
   - Refactored version 1 to Colt's way and then flipped the cells my way.
